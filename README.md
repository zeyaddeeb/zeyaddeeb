# Hey, I'm Z 👋

## 🛠️ What I'm Into

- **Kubernetes**: Because why run one container when you can orchestrate a whole bunch?

- **Monorepos**: One repo to rule them all.

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform and Helm are my best friends.
  
- **Rust & Typescript**: My go-to languages for building fast and reliable software.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

All content of this repo is built with Typescript (Next.js), Rust and other fun stuff. Deployed on Kubernetes on AWS (good luck trying to break in), managed with Helm, and provisioned with Terraform.  
Yes, it's overkill for a personal site. No, I don't care. It's *fun*.
